### GamePlay Plan

A game based on hearthstone and YU-GI-OH!. 

* Selection of heroes with class specific skills to use in game.
* 5 Monster card zones
* 5 spell / trap zones

* A player may attack directly unless a monster is in defense position on their opponents side of the field.
* A monster can either be summoned in attack or defense

### TODO
* Make Game Server 
** Controls game flow
* Make Cards and board and everything

### Roadmap

Hand is linked to Deck 
A faction contains their side of the board.

### Server Logic
* Each client needs to know their client id on game start. which is stored locally.
* The client id is then used for their game data retrieval.
